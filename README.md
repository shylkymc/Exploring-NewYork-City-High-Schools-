# Exploring New York City High Schools

I used different data sources to make more robust and significant analyses. I used some demographic data, survey results, historical SAT data and so on. I have conducted exploratory data analysis first to better understand the data. For this purpose, I have used Pandas, Numpy and regular expression operations. Also, I merged and concatenated data sets and created a data frame. I then used Groupby and aggregation function for exploratory analysis. Furthermore, during my analysis I have found there are missing data points in the data. I have imputed these missing data points by using various methods. After that, I visualized the data by using matplotlib and basemap (for geo plots) libraries to better understand the data.

## Conclusion

I analyzed relationships between SAT scores and other factors for high schools in New York City. 

There are more English language learners in Manhattan than in other districts. 

Manhattan district is more secure than others.

The schools, which have more white or Asian students, are more successful than other schools, which have more Hispanic or black students.

The schools with higher female percentages are a little more successful in SAT exams.
