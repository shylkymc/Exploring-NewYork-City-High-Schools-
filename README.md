# Exploring New York City High Schools

I used different data sources to make more robust and significant analyses. I used some demographic data, survey results, historical SAT data and so on. I have conducted exploratory data analysis first to better understand the data. For this purpose, I have used Pandas, Numpy and regular expression operations. Also, I merged and concatenated data frame and used Groupby and aggregation function for exploratory analysis. Furthermore, during my analysis I have found there are missing data points in the data. I have imputed these missing data by sing various methods. After that I visualized the data by using matplotlib and basemap (for geo plots) libraries to better understand the data.

## Conclusion

I analyzed relationships between SAT scores and other factors for high schools in New York City. 

There are English language learners in Manhattan more than other districts. 

Manhattan district is more secure than others.

The schools, which have white or Asian students are more successful than other school, which have Hispanic or black students more.

The school with higher percentage of female are a little more successful in SAT exams.
